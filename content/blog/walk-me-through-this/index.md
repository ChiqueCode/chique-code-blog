Dear Reader, 

Let me walk you through my Blog as the journey I am going through myself at the moment. See I’ve been walking hand in hand with The Data Scientist bootcamp that I have started less than three months ago. I am passionate about many things as it turns out over the years, never pictured myself as a Programmer though, but life is good because it’s tricky, you just have to be clever. So here I am enjoying Coding like it was meant to be. 

I have two Bachelors degrees: “Economics” and “Interpreter”. A few certificates, etc…
But what really matters (;/) is that I found a strength within me to come to the foreign country and start life from the scratch when I was 23 years old, without even knowing a single person in New York. (This blog won’t be about crazy awesome life in New York City. Wrong URL). 

I work in a consulting company in Lower Manhattan and live in the forest. Yes. Seriously. 
Love it. Peaceful. You can hear your thoughts…. One of the reasons I have decided to get a blog because I heard myself. Have you ever experienced that?

And the other reason is that I recently remembered that I used to write back in a high school, I had my own article in a school newspaper. What’s once was my passion, can be the second time around?
 
I love playing tennis, I really do enjoy Pilates especially reformer, I read books, I am probably what society considers as a “bookworm”. "The Elite Club" I call it. Yes, I am a member of this club. Love my family, Spring? Work… The fact that it’s hard to explain my job to others (makes people confused - my favorite type of feelings). I love Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, skincare and fresh air. 

Me in a very few words: I wish I could’ve played more tennis, also me: I wish I didn’t say “I wish” in the previous statement, because truly it all depends only on one person. Simply you. *smile

My Goals, Dear Reader, honestly gone wild. 

Yours, <br>Kseniya
